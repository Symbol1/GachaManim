This is a presentation based on

## The Jupyter notebook

In order to compile, you need to download
[Noto Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)
to your working folder.
Make sure that
`noto-emoji-main/png/512/emoji_u????.png`
does point to actual pictures.

In order to compile, you also need make sure that these figures exist
(and are in the correct folders).

## The Keynote file

I use Manim in a Jupyter notebook to generate
static image slides and video slides.
I then import them into a Keynote file.
